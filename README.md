# Sales Data Analysis & Reporting Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
Businesses generate large volumes of sales data every day. Analyzing this data helps companies
understand revenue trends, product performance, and category-wise contribution.

This project focuses on analyzing structured sales data using Python to calculate revenue,
identify top and low-performing products, analyze category-wise and monthly sales trends,
and generate a business-ready report.

This project is developed as part of **Week-2 Internship Training** to simulate
real-world data analysis tasks handled by junior data analysts.
